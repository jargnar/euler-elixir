### Even Fibonacci numbers

#### Problem

https://projecteuler.net/problem=2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

#### Solution

Using Streams!

The below solution was inspired by [30-days-of-elixir](https://github.com/seven1m/30-days-of-elixir/blob/master/24-stream.exs).

```
fibs = Stream.unfold({0, 1}, fn {a, b} -> {a, {b, a + b}} end)
fibs
  |> Stream.reject(fn(x) -> rem(x, 2) != 0 end)
  |> Enum.take_while(fn(x) -> x < 4000000 end)
  |> Enum.sum
```
